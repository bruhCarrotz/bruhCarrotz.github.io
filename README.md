## Projects
### Automated Object Removal using Exemplar-Based Inpainting
- Researched and developed an automated object removal program using concepts of digital image processing such as exemplar-based inpainting using MatLab. [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uSVgg17T92mDnxO-7-5zfHUI0hzyXNlE/view)
  
### Personal Website
- This webpage you are looking at right now is developed using **HTML/CSS** and **JavaScript** as one of my personal projects. The webpage is hosted in GitHub Pages alongside **Jekyll** integration. Right now, it is still in its early stages of development, however, in the future, I plan to integrate more pages and commit to update it every so often. 

### American Sign Language (ASL) Interpreter
- Designed and developed a highly successful Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with transfer learning concept using **Python Tensorflow**. This model can accurately interpret American Sign Language (ASL) alphanumeric and phrases gestures with 97% accuracy level. It was recognized as the top undergraduate multimedia project in the class.
