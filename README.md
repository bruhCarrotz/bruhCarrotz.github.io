## Projects
### Personal Website
- This webpage you are looking at right now is developed using **HTML/CSS** and **JavaScript** as one of my personal projects. The webpage is hosted in GitHub Pages alongside **Jekyll** integration. Right now, it is still in its early stages of development, however, in the future, I plan to integrate more pages and commit to update it every so often. 

### American Sign Language (ASL) Interpreter
- Designed and developed a highly successful Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with transfer learning concept using **Python Tensorflow**. This model can accurately interpret American Sign Language (ASL) alphanumeric and phrases gestures with 97% accuracy level. It was recognized as the top undergraduate multimedia project in the class.

### Speech-to-Text Converter
- Developed a speech-to-text tool using Python, utilizing libraries such as **tkinter, PyAudio, etc.** with translation supported by multiple **Google API** and file writing features. The user-friendly GUI earned it a Top Three Best Work award from the university. [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PwejNuSXYeEBPsRTeCGwUkvZ384cv57H/view?usp=sharing)

### Bookkeeping Program
- Designed and implemented a simple income and expenses tracker program using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles along with stack and queue data structures. The project, written in **Python** involved writing the necessary code to handle income and expenses data efficiently and building a user-friendly GUI interface. [Demo Video]()
